# Particle Swarm Optimization

Python implementation of the PSO algorithm for 2D functions

- The First graph plotted shows the optimization process animated with the particles reaching the minima found over the 
contour of the function to minimize
- The Second graph shows the behaviour of the particles throughout the optimization process by plotting the altitude 
  reached in every iteration. Such behaviour drops to the local (or global) minima found by the PSO algorithm
